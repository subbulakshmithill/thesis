# Master Thesis
- Goal: Smart and efficient scheduling of electric vehicles in a single phase at a residential household with an unbalanced three phase distribution system.
- Gurobi solver for solving quadratically constrained problem.
- PowerFactory software to analyze the scheduling in a virtual grid.
- DDD.ipynb consists of the main code. Three cases are used for comparision.
  - Dumb scheduling
  - Day ahead scheduling
  - Dynamic scheduling
